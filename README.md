# iot-watering-system
Automated low power watering system 

# Description
This project aims to automate a watering system for a small garden.
Due to the lack of an outside spigot / outdoor faucet, a large 
reservoir and an intermediate container were used to store the water,
which then was pumped to the plants at a regular interval using
an arduino controlled pump.
