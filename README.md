# iot-watering-system
Automated low power watering system 

# Description
This project aims to automate a watering system for a small garden.
Due to the lack of an outside spigot / outdoor faucet, a large 
reservoir and an intermediate container were used to store the water,
which then was pumped to the plants at a regular interval using
an arduino controlled pump.

# TODO
* Implement the display
* Implement again wifi with low power option

# History
* Implement a second code version, where the wifi is disabled and the power consumption is drastically
reduced by hardware modification and use of deep sleep routines
* Implement first version with wifi
